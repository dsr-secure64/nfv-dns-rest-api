    description: |
     `sort` can be used to describe sorting rules with a possible unary negative (the `'-'` operator) to imply descending sort order. Only one sorting parameter is allowd.
     
     The use of `'&'` (logical AND) and `'|'` (logical OR) may be used to create a compound boolean expression for sorting.
